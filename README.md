# SoftwareTestingFundamentals

Software Testing Fundamentals (STF) is a platform to gain (or refresh) basic knowledge
in the field of Software Testing. If we are to ‘cliche’ it, the site is of the testers,
by the testers, and for the testers. Our goal is to build a resourceful repository of
Quality Content on Quality.
